# NagonBot.py


NagonBot.py is an attempt at recreating a chat-bot project by Neural Nine (Youtube) with the exception that this bot is programmed in Japanese. The name is reference to a Heian period japanese writer.


Recently, I made the bot functional, but he does not function properly. He always identifies the input sentence as a "Sayounara (good-bye)" class, which makes the response to be always from the same class. The mistake is probably in the training program which is generating a bad model, however, I have no been able to identify it yet.
